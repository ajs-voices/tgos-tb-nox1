# Scene Break (The First Case)

I managed to get unpacked, took a tour of the facility, had a workout, not that I needed one after the workout Henry put me through. My legs were slightly sore from the positions I’d been in and pushing them made me smile with the memories. I even managed to make dinner by the time Michaela showed up.

I was washing the dishes I’d eaten off of when a brunette walked in covered in blood graced the doorway to the tiny kitchen. “You Nox?” she asked.

I turned to look at her and her eyes were taking me in. Really taking me in like she was checking out the way I looked. I hadn’t showered yet, my hair was a mess and my clothes were rumpled and I was a fine mess. But she looked me up and down then looked at my face with a smile. “You’ll do. Tomorrow 8 am and we’ll open that envelope.”

I nodded. “Okay.” I grinned at her, “Mind my asking what you just came from?”

Michaela shrugged, “Was a mountain lion attacking a flock. Park ranger and all that.” She smiled. “Mundane tasks are more my job than anything.”

“Sounds great.” I smiled. “You hungry? I have some leftovers.”

“You cooked?” Michaela sounded intrigued.

“I did. There wasn’t much in the commissary so I made a good standby spinach and bacon frittata.”

“What’s that?”

“Basically a baked omelette.”

“Breakfast for dinner? I’ll bite.” She laughs.

I pulled the leftovers out of the oven and set it down on the table for her. “Should still be warm.” I peeled the foil back and the steam rolled out. “See.” I did a little reheat with my ability too. She’d never know the difference.

I saw her eyes roll to the back of her head as the fragrant food hit her nose as she sat down. But she didn’t say anything. Then again she didn’t need to the way she devoured the food. She looked under the foil and frowned. “You cook like this all the time? I heard you had peculiar needs.”

“I cook like this for all meals yes.” I grinned, “With in reason of course. I know it’s not likely I’ll have eggs and fresh milk out in the woods. But I can do a lot with canned beans and beef jerky.”

Michaela laughed. “You have cooking duty for the extent of your stay with me.”

I nodded, “Wouldn’t have it any other way. I should get some sleep. Been a long day.”

She chuckled softly, “I’m sure the sex had nothing to do with it.”

“Not a thing.” I grinned as I turned to head towards my room. “Though I could go another round if I had to.”

I hadn’t made it around the corner before Michaela was catching up to me and slowed to walk beside me. “Was that an offer?”

I stopped and gave her a look, obviously checking her out and grinned. “Maybe. But I have an early day tomorrow.” I leaned in and whispered, “And I hear my boss is kinda a hard ass so I don’t want to piss her off on my first day.”

Michaela gave me a hearty laugh. “And I hear you are a handful and a half and that men are your preference. Was that wrong?”

I smiled. “I like women just fine.” I reached around her shoulder and whispered in her ear, “I’d fuck you if you weren’t covered in blood and smelling like dead things.” I grinned as I pulled away from her holding my nose and she laughed and opened her door. “I’m in here if you change your mind.”

I didn’t change my mind. I had too many fond memories to play through in my dreams before I was taken off into my nightmares.
