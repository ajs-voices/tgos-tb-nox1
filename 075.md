# Scene Break (Recovery)

The darkness was empty. At least at first, but then I started hearing sounds and I could move. I didn’t try to open my eyes. I heard Michaela off in the distance. I heard beeping. And other voices as I stirred. “He’s coming around.”

“He’s lucky.” I heard a male voice sound off.

“Mr. Sétanta, how are you feeling?”

I tried to speak but found it was difficult as a cup was thrust into my hand and Michaela said, “Drink it.”

I was obedient and tipped the cup to my lips and the cold refreshing liquid trickled down my throat and I felt better. I covered my eyes with my free and and blinked open until my eyes adjusted.

I was sitting in the same room my mother had been in when she had died. I tried to leap out of bed but found that my legs were bound to the bed. “You need to hold still your muscles are healing.”

I glanced down and saw the bandages covering my leg from ankle to knee. “Michaela found you lying on the ground in the Dragon’s house.”

I blinked at him. “And the dragon?”

Michaela smiled, “Dead. I don’t know how you did it Nox, but you did it. No one has ever survived dragon’s fire to our knowledge.”

A woman in the background spoke then, “I’d like to know how you did that.”

“Did what?” I asked.

“Survived Dragon’s Fire. No one, like Ms. Donovan said has done that.”

I shrugged. “My head hurts can we talk about it later.” My head didn’t really hurt, my leg did. Like a mother fucker, but she didn’t need to know and I wasn’t really in the mood to talk about it right then.

The man handed me a few pills. “This should help the pain. It might knock you out.”

I shook my head, “Are you giving me Venatori doses or Human ones?”

“Venatori.” He tapped my forehead.

“I’ll pass thanks. I don’t want to go into liver failure.”

Michaela chuckled, “He doesn’t react well to Venatori meds and human ones aren’t strong enough.”

The man nodded, “If you change your mind, Mr. Sétanta.”

“You brought me all the way back to Boulder?”

Michaela shook her head. “No. I took you to a safe house, and when you were stable we moved you here.”

“How long was I out of it?”

“About six hours after I found you.”

“I’d like to leave this room.” I said and Michaela looked around.

She sighed, “It’s the only intensive unit we have. Sorry. You can’t leave the confines until that burn heals completely. I’m surprised you didn’t lose the legs, but your muscles are repairing themselves even after their near destruction by the flames. What did you do?”

I shrugged. “I just did what I could to put the fire out.”

“But water doesn’t work, Nox. No one can survive dragon’s fire but a dragon.”

I shrugged. “I don’t know Mich. I just did.”

“You are one lucky sob. You know that right?” She smiled. “I bet you did this just to get out of the rest of your year with me.”

I laughed. “Never. I’m having too much fun hunting lions, and tigers and bears.”

“Oh my.” Mich laughed. “We havn’t hunted any tigers. Maybe I should go see about finding us one for when you are better?”

I grinned, “I’m good. Let’s keep it tame for now.”

She smiled and pressed a kissed to my forehead. “I’m glad you are a stubborn ass and a quick thinker.” She looked like she wanted to say something but but she didn’t. “You rest. Don’t get up Nox, or they’ll tie you down. I swear it, they will tie you down and not in the fun kinda way.”

“Is that an order?” I asked playfully.

She grinned. “Yeah, it is. Don’t move.” The command in her voice went straight places it shouldn’t and she knew it. Her grin grew wider as she left the small glass room full of lights leaving me all alone with the beeping machines.
