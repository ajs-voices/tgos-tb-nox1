# Scene Break

We went for two rounds before Mich decided she needed a shower and I finished packing her things. Michaela was a slob. Like everything was on the floor slob. Clean, dirty, it didn’t matter. All on the floor.

My roommates might claim I’m a neat freak but I really don’t care about the dust bunnies on the floor or the cob webs in the corners of her room. Though they’d drive me nuts because they just don’t belong there and I’d have to clean them, but it’s not because it’s about being clean. I learned a long time ago that I thrived on order. And dust bunnies and cobwebs were part of chaos. As was a closet that wasn’t ordered, or a drawer that was a mess. So maybe I’m a neat freak. But it’s all about order.

The problem with my gift is that I see the patterns of normalcy. And if there is chaos among that normal order of things it messes with the patterns. Chaos is part of human life. I get it. I adapt as I can, but it’s hard. So I keep things orderly. So I don’t have to adapt as much. It’s why I eat the same things every week in a specific order. It’s why I have a schedule for wake up, workout, eat etc. I’ve learned to cope. And Mich was the opposite of me.

But it was easy enough to pack her a bag, and get her gear together. Most of it was already packed.

She came out naked, drying hair with her towel and smiling at me. “Ain’t you a doll?” She looked around, “You get that…”

“Yes, Mich. I got everything you always take with you.”

“What about..”

“Mich, trust me. I’m far more anal about things than you are. I got it. Trust me.”

She sighed. “Do I have to?”

I nodded with a wry grin. She smiled at me and pushed me down on top of the bed and straddled my body. My cock was at the ready and she squirmed against me. “If I have to trust you. You have to trust me.”

“Uh, okay. I do trust you.”

“No.” She leaned down and pressed her mouth to my neck and grabbed my cock through my jeans. “Trust me.”

The panic welled up. “Mich, it’s not about trust.”

She huffed and flew off of me and started getting dressed.

“Mich, it’s not about trust. It’s about an anxiety attack. About how much having protection is ingrained into my brain. I’m half human. There any countless things that I could catch. And you’d never even know you had it. God forbid I got you pregnant.”

Mich pulled her jeans on over her legs with no panties and my cock twitched again in my jeans making them far more uncomfortable then they had been before. “What if you got me pregnant. Would that be so bad?”

I stared at her. “You … You want to have my kid?”

She shook her head. “Would it be so bad if I did? I mean you should have tons of girls trying to get into those tight fucking jeans of yours, but you don’t. Because why, you’re gay?”

“It’s more than that.”

“No Nox I don’t think it is. I think you want all your peers to think it’s all men all the time so you don’t have to deal with their emotions. You and I can have sex because for me it’s nothing more than sex. That’s all it will ever be. You know I’m not going to give a flying fuck once you leave. You think there are a lot of guys around here willing to fuck me.”

“You’re gorgeous, Michaela. Of course there are.”

She sighed. “And just like you, I have my own airs. They don’t come near because they are afraid of me. You are either too stupid or you don’t care.”

“I’m neither, Mich and you know that.”

“Nox. You are one of the most fucking powerful Venatori I’ve ever met. I **want** to have your kids. I don’t want marriage. I don’t want a life with you. But I want your seed to impregnate me and maybe we’ll have even more powerful kids than you. And in the off chance we have one lesser well that’s a chance I’m willing to take too. I got a few years left before they start hounding me. Help me out Nox. Go without the rubber suit.”

I flopped back on to Michaela’s bed and groaned. “Mich. I don’t know if I can. And what about what I want.”

She laughed. “You want to raise your kids?”

I frowned. “Not right now. I just fucking graduated. I can’t even take care of myself yet. But I don’t want the fucking Venatori taking care of my kids either. I don’t want them to end up feeling unloved and unwanted like I did my whole life.”

She came over fully dressed and sat on top of my thighs one leg on the other side of mine. “How about I make you a promise then. I promise that I will raise our kid. If our kid has your talent I will send them to the Academy early so they can learn from the best - you after of course they get through that first year.”

I sighed. “And what if something happens to you? or me?”

“If something happens to me, I’ll insure they go to you. And then if something happens to you. He or she can go to Dorian Vega. Or someone else you deem worthy. Nox. There is no guarantee this will even work, but we have time.”

“Fuck, Mich.” I groaned and put my hands on her hips. “Fine, but not every time. Please. I won’t make it the rest of the year if you send me into an anxiety attack every time you want to have sex.” I grinned up at her. “You are rather insatiable. But I have one more question.”

“Shoot.”

“What if at a later date before they come to the Academy I want to see them, or get to know them?”

“Just let me know. We’ll work something out Nox. I promise you, this is for the best.” She leaned down and kissed me hard. “Agreed?”

I nodded. “Yeah. Agreed. But not until after we get done helping my mom.”

“Of course.”
