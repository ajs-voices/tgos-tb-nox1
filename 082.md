# Scene Break

It was a good thing the car wasn’t far. I couldn’t just go to a hospital. Which was likely closer. I might only be half Venatori but my DNA and blood work was definitely going to raise alarms. Fuck even my blood type might throw off warning signals. Venatori just didn’t go human doctors. So I had no where but to go except to another facility with an Infirmary. The closest one was two hours away. I hoped I could make it.

I could feel the lights drawing in and out in my mind’s eye. Every second passed the closer I crawled towards death.

I made it to the car and started it left handed. That was far harder than anything else. I don’t know why I hadn’t thought of using my power to turn the key until after I’d already managed. I chalked up the distraction to the pain. I was almost numb to it now tho.

I pulled out onto the road, then the highway and I drove the speed limit. I blinked away the fog, but kept on going. My music played and I drove.

I had blinders on, nothing but the speed limit and the signs in front of me. I watched as mile marker after mile marker flew past and then I saw the sign for Alexandria. I blinked. What? Already.

I looked at the time on my phone and it was two hours later.

I sighed. I had made it. But the clock still ticked. I used a wash of water and air to rinse the blood from my arm and the seat while I pulled into the driveway of the Alexandria safe house. The car in gear and I glanced down at my arm and saw nothing.

Nothing? Wait..

I turned on the interior light, not that it wasn’t already bright from the sun. I don’t know what was going through my mind. But my arm, there was no cut, only a simple dimpled scar where the teeth and punctured my arm.

I let the power go and got out of the car. I grabbed my overnight bag from the back seat and headed inside.

The Alexandria safe house wasn’t really much, but it had facilities to help the infirmed. But I didn’t need it despite all the blood. I wasn’t asked any questions as I headed into the locker room. I took a shower. A long hot shower. I was dazed. I was weak and tired, but I was alive. I was going to stay here for a little while just to make sure I was alright and near help if needed but the wound was healed except the small scar of a mount on my right forearm.

I wasn’t sure what was going on. I was completely dazed at the moment I needed a few hours of rest and then maybe I could figure it all out.
