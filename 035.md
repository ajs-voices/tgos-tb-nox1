# Scene Break

Michaela was insatiable. It was either a long time since she got some, or she had ulterior motives. I wasn’t going to dwell on it. I had enough on my mind - specifically the lack of protection. With humans there was always the risk of pregnancy and STDs. With the Venatori not so much but it was a rule to always wear that protection. I didn’t know what human diseases did to me. I got the common cold, no telling what else I could get. I could heal a broken bone in minutes, but it I could still get sick. It was like my body didn’t know how to react to invaders. Venatori don’t get sick. But not all half human’s got sick. Not all could heal either. It really was a toss up what genetic make up we got when we were conceived.

When Michaela finally drifted off to sleep on my shoulder I slipped out of bed and went to the shower. I needed to wash the sex from my body. But also the water had healing properties. I knew on a high level that I was in the middle of a panic attack. I functioned to the point of getting to the bathroom and turning the water on before my breathing became almost too ragged to breathe. I threw up a sound barrier so she’d not know the extent of my issues. Last thing I needed was Michaela doubting my sanity.

I climbed into the shower’s scalding hot stream and yelped as I jumped backwards avoiding the stream against my body. I slipped and tumbled to the floor of the shower the shower head beating down it’s hot stream on my body. Fuck!

I was fine other than the panic coursing through my veins. It was like the hot water outside was boiling the insides. I turned the hot off with a quick twist and felt the water cool and then become frigid. Cold wasn’t better but it was at the moment. Enough that I could get the water to a normal temperature.

I let the water wash away the attack. I focused on my breathing. Paid no mind to the knocking on the door until Michaela was standing in the bathroom, “Nox what’s wrong?”

“Nothing.” But even I didn’t sound convinced when I said it.

“You want to grab breakfast?”

I nodded but she couldn’t see me. “It’s later than I wanted to get started lets go.”

I followed my instructions and hoped out of the shower. I knew Michaela was eyeballing me as I wrapped the towel around my wait. She smirked but as I walked past her I heard the tell-tale gasp of her seeing the scars. Michaela grabbed my arm, “Nox what happened.”

I shook my head. “I don’t want to talk about it.”

I walked out to my bag and got dressed quickly. There was no show, no entertainment, not that Michaela would have seen anyway she was still in the bathroom. I was pulling my arms through my sleeves of the hoodie when she walked out asking, “Is that why you always cover up?”

I nodded. “Saves having to use a veil all the time so that people can’t see.”

“Did someone hurt you?”

“I don’t want to talk about it Michaela.” I said as I walked over to her and pulled her against me. Her smile widened. “I have issues with what we did last night you going to mind if I talk to my therapist in front of you about you?”

She smirked, “You really aren’t shy are you?”

I shrugged. “I’m an open book.”

“You aren’t. I’m not getting anything about the scars.”

I smirked, “Because I’m not thinking about it. I don’t like thinking about it. You’ll get a ring side seat at some point.” I leaned down and pressed my lips to hers then let her go wanting for breath. “Let’s get some breakfast and on the road.”
