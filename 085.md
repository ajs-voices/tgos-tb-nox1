# Scene Break

Scott directed me to the back of the line but I grabbed his hand. I wanted to try my luck with the bouncer. Scott sighed, “You aren’t going to get in.”

I grinned at the leather clad boy who wanted to be bitten. “You don’t know me.”

We went to the front of the line and I ran my fingers through my hair and made sure that the bouncer saw the tattoo on my temple. He straightened a little and I gave him a friendly smile. “I’m looking for someone. I promise I won’t make any trouble.”

The bouncer looked at me then at Scott. Scott shrugged. “I can make it worth your while.”

“We don’t take bribes.” The bouncer said.

“I just want to look around. I’ll buy a drink or two and if I don’t find who I’m looking for I’ll move on.”

The bouncer looked at me and frowned. “Who are you looking for?”

“Cari Giovanni.” I said without any humor in my voice.

“You won’t find The Hound here.” He said. “She won’t step foot in here without a reason.”

“So you know where I can find her?” I asked.

He sighed and whispered into his ear comm but I heard every word. “C’è un Feras qui in cerca di Il Cane.” Sadly I only understood Feras and Il Cane, but I suspected that he just told someone who I was looking for.

I didn’t make out what the response was on the other side of the line, but he lifted the velvet rope and escorted us in. “Don’t make any trouble.” He scolded as we walked into the door. “Don’t plan on it.”

I wrapped my arm around Scott and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “And that is your thank you for showing me the way. Good luck.” I said then headed into the club. I could feel the energy everywhere, it was all vampire. This was the worst place to be alone. But I had been to plenty of supernatural clubs before. This was nothing different. I pulled my shields up around me and headed for the bar.

But as soon as I waded about halfway through the crowd a cute blond and tall dark and handsome stepped into my path with smirks on their face. “We heard you were looking for Il Cane?” said the dark completion with the meditation accent to go with it.

I nodded and tall dark and handsome spoke again. “You aren’t getting any closer to her, she’s done nothing wrong that you should be hunting her.”

I grinned at him. “I’m not going to hurt her. I just want to say I found her.”

The blond chuckled. “Ballsy. You aren’t going to find her. She’s gone. And even we don’t know where she went.”

I sighed. “And you are?”

I heard a hushed whisper on the air and I laughed. “Del Figlio and her Chevalier. I am close.” I said proudly.

“You have good hearing for Feras.” The blond said.

“I’m not like other Venatori.”

“Obviously. No other Venatori is stupid enough to hunt my mother.” So tall dark and handsome was Del Figlio - the Son of the Hound. There were all sorts of rumors about him. And so many more about her Chevalier and here I was standing in front of them I felt almost like Sage at a comic book convention. The excitement that coursed through my body.

“I like him Ant.” The blonde said the other man. I was learning more and more. I had to hunt my history lessons. Anthony Giovanni was the given name of Del Figlio and her human servant was Ryan Elliot, or at least that’s what they said. Some people beleived Il Cane’s Chevalier changed. But I didn’t think Ryan was just a name for her most top male, no I was pretty sure he’d been with her from the beginning. He carried himself like he was much older than he looked. He’d seen a lot. I had so many questions.

“Maybe you can answer some questions for me since I won’t get close enough to her.”

“What do you want to know?” Del Figlio said with a curious tilt to his head.

“I don’t know. Everything. How often does one actually get to talk someone so close to Il Cane.” I said a little too fan boyish. I sighed. “Alright, I’m going to go sit down at the bar and have a few drinks. I am way to excited about meeting you.” I stepped through the pair of them and moved towards the bar. The crowd parted for me. I didn’t look back but I expected that the crowd parted for the gentlemen following me. I could hear the blonde’s breathe close by. Vampires don’t breathe. I had to take a note of that. When sneaking around vampires. I can’t hear them like I expect to.

I headed for a single barstool but they flanked me as I sat down. The men who had frequented those seats before had fled as the two more powerful men stood behind them. It was almost like the entire bar left as I sat down. But it was only the side I’d chosen. The rest was still hopping.

The bartender came over to me. He was a cute blonde too with blue green eyes that were hidden behind the long hair in front of his face. He looked at the two men surrounding me. “Whatever he wants Zach and a round for each of us too.”

I looked at the blonde - Ryan. I had to remember even though he hadn’t introduced himself. He grinned at me with a bright white smile and a nod towards the bartender. I looked back at Zach with a smile. “Sam Adam’s Irish Red, if you have it if not any Sam will do.”

He gave me a bright smile and nodded. “I got a Red.” He said as he slipped off towards the cooler.

Ryan was shaking his head. “You drink a beer when you could have had anything on the shelf?”

“I didn’t assume you were paying. And I will stick with beer thank you.” I looked around. “There is too much power here for me to let down my guard too much.”

Del Figlio laughed and it cut off as quickly. “You think too loud and if you call me Del Figlio again even if it’s in your head I’m going to throw you out on your head. Got it Feras. You can call me Ant - everyone does.”

I smiled at tall dark and handsome and gave him a wink since he was listening in. “Alright Ant, and you can call me Nox. I’d prefer that then to the slur you keep using.”

Ryan chuckled. “Ryan. Alright then.” Zach set the beers down in front of us and I took a good long swig of it. I was here with fucking Anthony Giovanni and Ryan Elliot. No one was going to fucking believe me. If they even knew who the fuck they were.
