# Scene Break

I looked at the woman next to me and she was frowning at my sudden outburst. “What was that last call?”

The woman was older than I realized. I apologized. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have drifted off.”

“Must have been a good dream.” She smiled at me. “You had a smile until you were startled. It was a call for Memphis.”

I nodded. “Thank you. It was a good dream.”

She asked, “Where are you heading young man?”

Nox smiled. “You can call me Nox. I’m heading to Boulder to do some hunting.”

“You don’t look much like a hunter to me?” She smiled. “Look more like you want to win a fashion show.”

Nox laughed at the assessment. “I am not that gay ma’am.”

She paled a little before she said, “I didn’t mean to imply.”

Nox smiled. “You didn’t imply anything. Well maybe a little. But I fashion isn’t my thing despite the fact that I have frequented men’s beds before. But a woman such as yourself meant no harm by that. I took it for what you meant it as. A stab at the makeup and hair.”

Her face had brightened as I spoke. “My name is Emma. And I do think the color adds to the whole on ensemble.” She chuckled at her words.

“Surely you aren’t traveling alone. Where is your husband? I’m surprised he hasn’t dashed over her to rescue you from the predator of a boy you are chatting up.”

She laughed again. “Lenny passed a few years back, my granddaughter, Emily is with me. She’s taking me to stay with her mother in Denver.”

A woman who looked like a much younger version of Emma sat down next to her. “This must be your twin Emma.” I said which made her blush.

“No, no this is Emily, my granddaughter.”

I held out my hand and she just stared at it so I return it to my lap, “A pleasure. Your grandmother was just telling me about moving to Denver.”

“Gran. Why are you telling a stranger this?”

“He’s harmless Em. He’s just entertaining an old lady. He says he’s going hunting.”

Emily let out a curt laugh and my smile faded even before the words left her mouth. “Dressed like that?”

“What’s wrong with the way I’m dressed?” My eyes narrowed and my voice lowered as I leaned forward to examine her closer. “You think because I wear eyeliner and paint my nails I can’t shoot a gun, or a crossbow?” I didn’t need either but I could shoot both well enough my certification in firearms had been a no-brainer for me. I could see how things would interact with one another - the pattern of movement.

Emma patted my knee. “She didn’t mean anything by it. Your outward appearance is just…”

“Gay. I got it. Thanks.” I said with higher voice than normal and a flip of my hand I added. “I’ll just go over here.” I stood up and walked away from the darling elderly woman and her stereotyping granddaughter.

I heard Emily say to her grandmother as I left, “Well that was rude.”

I wanted to turn back and say something more but I sashayed away from them in my best ‘hey look at me I’m gay’ walk. I stopped at the terminal counter and smiled at the woman. “Will you make sure I’m awake when the Denver flight is boarding?” I gave the woman my sweetest smile

“Of course, honey.” She said with a smile.

“I’ll just be right here.” I pointed to the chairs next to her station. And then I sat down, maybe I could get back to sleep and flirt with the man in my dream. That had been going somewhere. But it was quickly fading and all I remembered was those blue eyes and his breathe on my neck.
