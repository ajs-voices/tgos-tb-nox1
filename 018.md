# Scene Break

The final phase of Ad Aetatem was our first hunt, or our first job or whatever it was that we were going into for some that meant going to college. It had for Dorian. Some it lasted a year, others 4 to 6 depending on what you did. Dorian was going to school while he worked with me. He was a Vega - things were expected of him. Oddly enough Dorian went to school for psychology. He could have done the therapist thing, and was probably why he was my defacto guardian through it all.

So it was Dorian who padded up to me in his patent leather shoes and his finely pressed suit handing me my assignment. He waited patiently while I wretched. He patted my back when I was done and nodded. “I remember that feeling.”

I didn’t ask if Dorian threw up too. I didn’t really need to know. But he knew what it was like for me that was enough. Of all the people in the AU building, Dorian was the only one who I considered family. He handed my my packet. “Your plane ticket and assignment are in here. And a little extra spending money from Dae’lin and myself so you can buy the gear you need.”

I nodded. “Thanks Dorian.” I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and hugged him. Dorian patted my back in true Dorian fashion He didn’t want to ever get too close to me. I sighed and nodded. “I’ll see you in about a year.”

Dorian gave me a last pat on the back before he pulled away. “Don’t die on me, son.”

I grinned at him. “Never even dream of i t.”

I took my envelope will all my things needed and headed to my dorm room for the last time. Aaron was still in line waiting his turn so I was pretty much free and clear for leaving without a scene.

I saw Madison standing with a group of friends and she gave me a little wave. There was a strange of green in her hair. She was one of few Magnus who actually enjoyed some of my tricks. She colored her stands just like I did - with a little help from the elements. She didn’t look down on me as most of the others girls did. But she had taken pity on me once when I was thirteen - my first sexual encounter. She was sweet about it. But like most others she spread rumors to make herself look good. I had become known as the whore when it was she who had come on to me strong and took control of the situation.

I didn’t really care then or now. I gave her a quick wave as I walked past. It was the extent of our interactions.

I saw my first crush too before I left. He was standing by the kitchenette in the dorm level when I got there. He watched me walk past him and I gave him a simple nod. Dylan was going on his first hunt too. But he was going to be an instructor. He had that kinda pull. Me I wanted to hunt to be on my own.

My room was empty when I walked in, but Ross quickly followed me inside. “Leaving?” He asked.

“Yeah. Dorian got me a hotel just outside the airport so I could get their in plenty of time without freaking out more.”

Ross laughed. “I won’t miss your early mornings.”

“You won’t miss me at all.” I said as I picked up my already packed bag.

Ross grinned at me. “You are probably right. Good luck Nox.”

“You too.” I said as I walked out of our shared bedroom for the last time. I would never have to share a room again.
