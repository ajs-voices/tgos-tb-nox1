# Scene Break (Going, Going, Gone)

I woke with Ophelia curled on my chest and a major mess to clean up. It was rare that the dreams left me spent, but I’d been holding back for far too long for two weeks. And it had been worth it. My dream guy made my day, whatever he’d done, or was doing kept me with him all night long. It was sex and it was more and I was going to see him soon.

Those next few days couldn’t come fast enough. Ophelia and I managed to get home in another days time and I arranged with Sage our Friday night meeting - told him I wasn’t going home with him and Dee. Sage said he had news, but he wouldn’t tell me. Mia and Jace would be there for a little while, but Mia wasn’t going to be able to drink. A bun in the oven and all that I was told. But she’d be there for my birthday.

I reported to Dae’lin first thing the morning after I got back. I was still flying high from our encounter and the thought I’d see him soon. I almost wished I’d waited until I saw him for that release, but shit happens. I hadn’t meant to come, but I was gone.

I knocked on Dae’lin’s door. “Come in.” I opened the door and my former mentor looked up at me. “You. Are you in trouble?”

I shook my head and handed her an envelope with her name written on it. She laughed, “Oh. Let’s see, sit down.”

I sat down and she clacked away on her archaic computer and then looked at me. “Your Birthday is soon so I don’t want to put you on any one case right now. How about you do some research like you did in the Academy and then after your birthday we’ll get you assigned something. Michaela’s report is enlightening.”

I frowned. I didn’t know if that was a good thing or not. She saw it and smiled. “It was a good report. She mentioned you were going to hunt Il Cane. Did you find her?”

I nodded and then shook my head. “Well kinda. I found Del Figlio and her Chevalier. They entertained me at her estate for a few weeks. I learned a lot about vampires.”

Dae’lin frowned, “Don’t let anyone know you spent quality time with a vampire.”

I smiled at her. “Aw, why not? I think they’d enjoy ribbing me about that.”

She sighed and then tapped away at her computer and the printer behind her spit out a few pages slowly. “Work these cases until your birthday. You always were good at the research.” She handed me the paper and then started back at her work clearly dismissing me. I was used to it. So I was off again to my room.

Along with the envelope for Dae’lin I had one of my own. It told me which floor to go, which wing I was in and what door I should use.

I had never been in the adult residences. It was much like the dorm rooms, long rows of doors with a rune stone embedded in them. It looked very sci-fi like almost Twilight Zone era creepy. Each rune was attuned to a person, It was all magic the Venatori had long since forgotten but the attunement was easily done and so was never really lost. The rune glowed a little brighter as I approached. The best part about it was I could atune the door to open and close for Ophelia. She could roam the halls and be free.

We had a long conversation. Rather I talked at Ophelia on the trip home, and I’d pretty much talked all the time to her when I was in my room.

“Hey Ophelia, I’m back.”

There was a soft meow from the bed and the gray scruffy looking cat lifted her head to acknowledge my existence and then set it back down. It was rather funny how easily we fell into living together so quickly. But cats weren’t exactly the most friendly of creatures either.

My life consisted of nightmares, food, working out and researching the pages for the next three days but no visits from my dream man. My schedule was readjusting and my sleep was sporadic because of the anxiety it caused. When Friday night came I was ready to go out and have some fun. I was anxious though. I could feel my heart in my throat. I was sweating like crazy and my breathing was erratic. I was having a full blown panic attack but I pushed through it. I didn’t let myself cower in the corner. I was going to meet my dream guy and god help us we’d actually like each other.

I rummaged through my clothes four times before I called Mia who told me just to wear whatever, it didn’t matter, he was going to either run for the hills or kiss me the moment he saw me. And then it was all about being naked…

I rolled my eyes but she didn’t see it. I told her, “I’m going to be late. I hate being late.”

“Nox, settle down. Get dressed and get the fuck out here. Sage has something he wants to tell you.”

I sighed. “I’ll be there when I get there.” I said hanging up the phone.

I pulled on a black button up shirt and my phone rang as I was pushing my left arm through. “What Mia?”

A female voice sounded, but it wasn’t Mia’s, “Nox. Dad’s been hurt.”
