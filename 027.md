# Scene Break

I got my rental which I’d drive to a Boulder shop and then I’d grab a cab to HQ. But first I’d drop Henry off at his hotel and see where things went from there. As we walked to the carry-on baggage terminals he kept glancing at me like he was ready to bolt.

And after I picked up the keys to the rental I was almost certain he had taken off but I found him outside looking both directions and then smiling shyly when I came up next to me. “I can just drop you off.”

Henry smiled. “No. I think I’ll just grab the shuttle to the hotel.”

I nodded with a feigned smile. I was a little disappointed but I understood. I’d never been this guy, but I knew what it was to have your fears right in front of you and the only thing you can do is back away from them. “Alright, Henry. I’ll give you a call in a year if you still want me to.”

Henry frowned. “I don’t know.”

I sighed and nodded and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “You’re a good person. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. See ya round, Henry.” I turned and walked towards the rental cars. I crossed the street and was about to walk into the tunnel for the rentals when an hand grabbed my arm.

“You really weren’t going to try to talk me into it?” He asked. He seemed almost hurt.

I shrugged. “Henry, I don’t play games with people. I’m always upfront about what I what. I’m not desperate for sex. Unless you want me to beg, that’s different, and that takes negotiation up front.”

“But I wanted to, then I didn’t and then I did.” And he was blushing from ear to ear.

“And now?”

“I don’t know. I’m scared. What if it hurts?”

I laughed and leaned in close to Henry. “You won’t hurt me and I’m not going to penetrate you, at least not with anything more than my fingers.”

“You mean you won’t finish again?” He frowned at me.

I grinned at him, “Do you want to talk about this here, or in the privacy of your hotel room?” I asked. He looked around and a older couple was frowning at us. Henry grabbed my hand and pulled me in the direction of the rental cars. I did the thing and we loaded our things into the trunk and I took the driver’s seat. Now I had learned to drive when I first turned 18. But I hadn’t driven since then. I sighed and wrapped my hands around the steering wheel.

I took several deep breaths before starting the car.

“You okay?” Henry asked.

“I haven’t driven in a while. And it’s an anxiety inducer.”

“Can I distract you and still be safe?”

I smirked. “I think we can talk and distract me enough.”

“What do you want to talk about?”

I gave him a wry grin as I pulled out of the parking spot and headed towards Henry’s hotel. “I’m capable of cumming without you touching my cock.”

I stole a glance at Henry as I drove down the road. He was blushing. I grinned at him and asked, “Tell me why you want to do this?”

Henry blushed. “I don’t know. I think you are cute.”

“Cute?” I laughed.

“Hot.” I stole another glace at him before turning into the driveway of the hotel. “And I want to see you naked.”

I parked the car and turned off the ignition and turned to look at Henry. “Have you ever checked a guy out in the locker room?” It was mostly curiosity. I know there is an etiquette to such but sometimes you can’t help but notice.

“I didn’t think so but now I’m wondering if I did, accidentally ya know?”

I grinned, “Just don’t do it on purpose, most guys don’t like being oggled by other guys specially in the locker room.”

“I wouldn’t ever. I’d be too scared they’d find out and then I’d never hear the end of it.”

I nodded, “In the closet, got it.”

Henry laughed. “I guess.”

I got out of the car and popped the trunk. “You want to do this?” I asked. I wanted him to be sure before I pulled my carry on bag out of the trunk. It had everything I’d need and then some. I didn’t want to presume anything.
