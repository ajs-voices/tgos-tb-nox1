# Scene Break (Colorado)

Landing was worse the taking off both Henry and I were doing our best not to freak out. His hand squeezed mine but he didn’t ask for a kiss. But I knew he was anxious and probably more so about taking me to his hotel room than landing.

Once off the plane I stopped to get my composure back. Henry stood in front of me with a smile. “You okay?”

I smiled up at him. “Just glad to be on solid ground again. Give me a few minutes.”

He sat down next to me and looked at me shyly.

“You don’t have to go through with this.” I said with a wry smile. I was more than happy to drive off into the sunset. Henry looked like the kinda guy who wanted more. I sighed. “I don’t do relationships.”

Henry’s smile slide off his face. He whispered, “So it was all about sex?”

I shook my head. “No. I… We needed the distraction and you were the one who asked me to kiss you.”

“But you were flirting with me.”

I nodded. “I flirt with everyone.”

Henry sighed. “I shouldn’t be surprised. You were flirting with the old woman too.”

“I was.” I grinned at him. “Am I the first guy you’ve noticed?”

Henry blushed. “No. But you are the first to hit on me.”

I stood up and offered Henry my phone. “Let’s do this time. We go our separate ways. When I get back to New York in about a year my brother asked me to take him out to pick up guys. I’ll take you too, if you and Nick hit it off great, if not then we’ll all go out and see about picking up a guy? Give me your number and I’ll call you.”

Henry took my phone and started tapping away at it. I chuckled mostly to myself but Henry looked up at me curiously, “I don’t take numbers or keep them when given to me and here I am taking yours so I can hook you up with my brother.”

“Is your family gay or something?”

I shook my head, “Farthest thing from it. He’s my half brother and our father is straight as an arrow.”

Henry laughed. “So you aren’t coming back to my room?”

“I don’t think I should. I don’t want to lead you on. You are a good guy and I’m not.”

“So I’m not your type?”

“As a matter of fact you aren’t. But that that’s not the reason. Seriously, Henry, you look like the type of guy who wants more. I don’t do more. I use sex to get close, feel loved and then I throw the relationship that could have been away. I don’t see that changing anytime soon. And I don’t want to hurt you. “

“The whole it’s you not me is just bullshit right?”

I nodded. “Yeah. I do. But This is me. I’ve never spent the night in a lover’s bed. I don’t usually ask names though I do freely give my own. I don’t keep phone numbers given to me and I don’t take someone home to my place. “

Henry handed my phone back to me and stood up. “So you are one of those guys?”

I nodded. “Yeah I am.”

He stepped into me and pressed his lips to mine. “I think that’s perfect.” He whispered. “If I suck at this you won’t want to see me again anyway.” His hand snaked around my waist and under my shirt and I let out a soft moan against his lips and he smiled. “Show me how to do this.”

I chuckled against his lips remember similar words from Sage’s mouth. I wrapped my arm around his waist and turned to walk away. “Let’s get our things and go to your room. We’ll take it from there.”
