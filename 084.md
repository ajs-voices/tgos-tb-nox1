# Scene Break

I should have napped instead I got a long shower. I didn’t know when Scott would show up. I expected near night fall or after. I had plenty of time so I lounged on the bed in boxers and a tank top while I sifted through the treasure box again. I had probably done it everyday since I found it.

I lifted the leather band of the watch to my nose and took a deep breathe, the smell of my mystery man was still present. I didn’t know when he’d worn it last and I was careful not to actually touch the leather. I didn’t want my scent mingling with his. It was a comfort that I took and was half asleep when there was a knock on the door.

I groaned as I pulled myself out of bed and to the door. I peered through the door and saw a man dressed in tight leather pants, and an tighter shirt. Like it was almost painted on. There was a thin collar around his neck and he was smiling shyly at me. “Scott?” I asked as I opened the door.

“Is this for me?” I joked. I knew he let the vampires bite him. He was a letter and he was turned on by their bite. And from the looks of it I was turning him on. He came in with his head ducked.

“I didn’t realized you’d be here so quickly.” I said. “Let me get dressed.”

“You don’t have to.” He said shyly.

“I don’t have to get dressed, you mean I can go in my boxers?”

Scott shook his head. “We don’t have to go anywhere, you can just bite me here.”

“What?” I asked confused.

He looked at me like I was an alien. He looked confused but that didn’t stop him from coming up to me. I instinctively backed up until I was pressed against a wall. Scott stalked me like a predator - like a vampire might stalk him. “You feel like a vampire. I can feel the power radiating off of you.” He said as he stood in front of me, pressing his chest to mine. I could feel his hardon through my boxers and it was only getting stronger as he sniffed at my neck like he could smell the power.

“Oh.” I said and pushed him away. “You are sensitive to the occult. I’m not a vampire. I’m not human but I’m not a vampire. Where’s this club at?” I said as I grabbed a pair of jeans, they were black but not nearly as tight as what Scott was wearing.

I pulled off the tank top I was wearing without really paying attention that my back was to Scott. I heard a gasp but didn’t comment as I pulled the t-shirt over my head and then tugged a long sleeved shirt on over it. It wasn’t my normal club going gear but it would do in a pinch. To emphasis that I wasn’t human I ran my fingers through my hair and knew my tips were turning the color of my shirt.

He was staring wide eyed at me and I waved my hand to the door as I tugged my last shoe on. “This club.”

“It’s called Frozen.” he stammered out. “I didn’t… Wait.”

I sighed. “What?”

He looked down and frowned. “I’m sorry. I thought.”

I sighed. “You thought what? I would take you here so you wouldn’t have to prostitute yourself at the club so you can feel the bit of a vampire?”

He nodded. “Don’t worry about it. I want to go to the club, so you can either tell me where it is, or show me, but either way I’m going with or without you.”

He sighed, but he headed for the door and I followed him out tucking my key into the pocket. I didn’t bother with anything else. Scott lead the way and I caught up to him and we walked towards a large looking warehouse type building with a blue flashing neon sign reading “Frozen”
