# Scene Break

Kia Viddens stood in the doorway staring at me. I saw an older set of chocolate brown eyes staring back at me. He had wrinkles around his face probably from the perpetual frown on his face. I don’t think I’d ever seen a smile on his face, even when he was with the Vega family. The fury at my biological father collided with the idolization I had of the man as a child. He was my fucking father. I wanted to spit but instead I stared back at the man who had ignored me my entire life.

Kai just stared back at me. Dorian moved around the room removing the cubes from each other and putting them back in the box that he’d brought with him. “Well don’t stand there and just stare, say something, boy.” Dorian chided.

I still didn’t know what to say, so the idiot in my took over, “Enjoy the show?” I said with a cocky grin that made my father’s frown deepen.

“You beat both records on tests.” Kai said flatly. “But you cheated.”

I grinned at him. “Because I can bend all four elements at the same time, I cheated. That’s a new one.” My voiced dripped with sarcasm.

Kai’s lips drew into a small smile and then vanished just as quickly. “I will see you and your mother at dinner tonight.” He said and then left without so much as a farewell.

Dorian chuckled. “That went better than I thought it would.”

I glared at Dorian. “Why was **he** here?”

Dorian sighed. “Your mother was upstairs too, but she refused to come down to see you.”

I was more hurt by that then the fact that Dorian had lied to me my whole life. Dorian was just doing his job. “You didn’t tell me because she said not to?”

Dorian smiled at me and put the box down on the table. He put his hand on my shoulder, “You know me, Nox. I would never lie to you without good cause.”

“My mother is not a good cause.” I said and walked away from Dorian.

Dorian called out after me. “Don’t forget dinner with your father.”

I called out behind me, “Yeah yeah.”

I walked the halls of the testing rooms thinking about the conflicting emotions I was having. For as long as I can remember I hated my father. He ignored me. Didn’t care. Didn’t love me. And even without asking I knew my father didn’t even know I existed until Dorian told him. My father turned out to be my childhood idol. The man to whom all Venatori hunters compared. He was the best at everything. He had the coolest talent - seeing into the future was rare. Even if he only saw glimpses of it. Kai Viddens was a precog, and none of his children inherited the ability. I kinda wondered why Kai didn’t foresee this. But then again, my ability didn’t work when I looked at myself in the mirror. I can see everyone else’s pattern in the mirror, but not my own. Chances are his didn’t work like that either.

I had some down time before I had to meet with Dae’lin before dinner with my parents. I was so not looking forward to that.
