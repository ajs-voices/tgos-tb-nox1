# Scene Break

After getting out on the road I let my mind wander a little. There I was in a cute boy’s bed who was all the more ready to keep fucking me and I had walked away so I didn’t piss of some Venatori who would likely be pissed at me even if i was early. But I was me and I didn’t want to make things any worse. I had already stayed too long with Henry. Thoughts of him got me through the hour trip to the center of Boulder and then the hour trip in the mountains to HQ near Horn Mountain.

It had been a very long time since I’d made this trip. The last time I’d been five. I remember it very clearly. I still have nightmares about it. It’s funny how much of my life started with nightmares. All because I had sparked. All because inside of me was a latent magic waiting to be taught. If I hadn’t sparked I’d probably be a normal kid with a normal life and my mother still might love me.

But I had sparked. I wasn’t a normal kid with a normal life and my mother didn’t know I existed beyond a blip in her life. I was nothing to her. At least with Kai I had a chance to fix things. At least that’s what Margo kept telling me. I’d called while I was driving. I needed to talk and my therapist was always on call. Granted I talked more with Megan, Mia’s mom than I did with Dr. Silverman but it was all good.

Now I was off to Michaela Donovan. A few years older than myself out in the backwaters of my birth place. No this wasn’t going to go easy. This was going to be the hardest damned thing I’d ever done in my life. I knew somewhere I was going to run into my mother and I was going to interrupt her perfectly fashioned life she had without me.

The trip was highly uneventful. My mind kept wandering to the blue eyed man in my dreams. And to Henry. His eyes weren’t blue but he made me smile just a little when I thought about him. That shy smile. The way he was excited and afraid at the same time. I don’t know if I ever felt that way about sex. Sex always just was apart of things. Like I had missed something so fundamental in it that it just was. For Henry it had meant more. I feel bad that I took that innocence from him. But I gave him ample time to say no.

I shouldn’t feel guilty, but I did. Same as with Sage. Sage was an innocent kid. Mia and I had corrupted him. But he had already been corrupted. He was the one who took us to Ooh. He was the one who watched complete strangers. We only gave him access to more intimate relations.

Driving didn’t make me late but by the time I pulled into HQ I knew I was going to get reamed for it.

HQ was much smaller than I remembered. It consisted of a large building and several small buildings behind it. All made of lumber like a giant had been playing with Lincoln Logs. It was all very rustic feeling.

Inside looked less modern than the outside, like they were stuck in the 60s. Everything had a soft yellow glow to it and I felt like I just wanted to go back outside in the warm weather and the bright light. I stopped at the front desk and waited for 10 minutes before the clerk there came over. He kept eyeing me like I was some alien or something. “Can I help you?” His voice sounded irritated as he pushed the archaic tube monitor his direction.

“Yeah, I’m looking for Michaela Donovan.”

He smirked. “You must be her rookie. She said you were coming.” He looked back at the clock on the wall and frowned, “You are early. Donovan said she’d be back before you got in. She’s out on patrol.” He glanced at the monitor and then rummaged around in a drawer and pulled out a key - a skeleton type key. “I guess you can go unpack. I’ll let her know you are here when she gets back.”

I was early? What the fuck?
