# Scene Break

Michaela waited until we were out in the car before she spoke. “What are you thinking Nox?”

“Two suspect ghosts. One more credible than the other.”

“You think the ghost is one of his dead family?”

“I think the ghost is the little girl - Ruby.” I said with confidence.

“Why her? She was just a kid.”

“A kid who was possibly abused and possibly murdered.” I said as I cranked the jeep up. “We need to find out who the therapist was and talk to this Mr. Foster. I think they will be next on the girls list.”

“Assuming it’s the kid.” Michaela smiled.

“What do you think I should do?” I asked curiously as I drove to the police station of the small town.

Michaela shrugged. “It’s your case.”

“So what do you think I’m doing wrong?” I asked.

She shook her head. “Nothing.” She smiled. “You’re goal in finding these people is…?”

“To stop the next murder and evict the ghost.”

“That’s one way to politely say kill.” Michaela said with a grin.

“Why do we need to kill the host?” I sighed.

“Because the ghost will just go to the next host.”

I shrugged. “Not if you help it fix what’s wrong. If this is the first murder there is still hope. It’s when they finish their task that the killing becomes mindless.”

“Not always Nox.”

“Show me a case study of the causes of ghosts just killing to kill!”

“Jack the Ripper’s ghost.”

“Really Jack the Ripper. The guy was a serial killer as a human. Of course his ghost is going to be a serial killer. Anyone else?”

“Nox, there doesn’t need to be a reason. One is enough.”

“This girl was raped and murdered and she killed her father.”

“Now you are pushing the limits of speculation with rape.” Michaela yelled.

“Am I?” I pulled into the station parking lot and took a spot near the back. We’d have to walk, but I turned to Michaela. “You know the signs of rape?”

“No. Do you?” She growled at me.

“Yeah I do. I know how it feels to have someone do something to you and no one fucking believe you. I know the strain it causes on a body. While I’ve not been raped physically, I have been abused over and over. So I know what I’m talking about.” I stormed out of the jeep slamming the door behind me and started walking to the station door.
