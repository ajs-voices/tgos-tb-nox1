# Scene Break

Ophelia and I jogged to the garage where the tow truck guy was busy working on another car. I sighed as I saw my vehicle sitting off to the side.

“I told you I’d come back.”

The man slide out from under the car and smiled at me. “I’ve done got an emergency. The mayor’s car done blew a gasket. I need to fix it right up. I’ll have you ready by the morning. That be alright with you?”

“Sure, whatever.”I sighed. “Where can I stay that’s pet friendly?”

“I see Miss Oma done found a home for that darn cat.”

“She a trouble maker?” I asked.

The man laughed. “You’ll see.”

Why was nobody willing to tell me about the cat. Surely the man didn’t know she was a cat possessed by a drowned Salem witch. Ophelia dug her claws into my shoulder. “Alright.” I said. “Place to stay please?”

He pointed to a bed and breakfast across the street. “Best damned breakfast this side of the state line.”

“Thanks.” I said and popped the trunk of my car and grabbed my overnight bag and took out a water bowl for Ophelia, everything else didn’t look important enough to take inside.

The B&B owner looked up when we walked into the sparse room. The house was old, the floors were original wood and gave the place a sort of old timey glow. Ophelia relaxed around my shoulder and purred as I approached the woman at the desk.

“I’d like a room to stay, my car is in line to be fixed. Won’t be ready till the morning.”

“Yes, sir. If you are a friend of Ophelia’s you are a friend of mine. A great mouser you got there.”

I glanced over my shoulder at the cat who was resting on my shoulders and sighed. “That’s good to know.” I said. “As long as I don’t get mice in my bed.”

Ophelia reacted with low growl but never opened her green eyes.

I followed the woman to a room and she handed me a skeleton key. An honest to fucking god skeleton key. She twisted the key in the lock and there was a loud cherchunk. “Best room in the house.” She said.

“Thank you.”

Before I closed the door she called after me, “The shower’s communal and two doors down to your right.”

I sighed. “Thanks.” I hated communal showers. I’d gotten used to having one in my room with Michaela. They were tiny studio apartments - minus the kitchen.I missed the Venatori magic of home, but I’d be home soon enough.

Ophelia jumped down off my shoulders and made herself at home on a seat by the windows, the waning light was streaming through and she looked like she was basking in all her own glory. She looked at me wtih wide green eyes and then I could have seen her smirk before she curled up on the seat and drifted off to sleep.

I was exhausted. I could take a shower later I said to myself as I sat down on the bed. It was an old feather mattress. Soft considering some places were poking me through the lining. But I laid down and before I knew it I was drifting into my happy place.
